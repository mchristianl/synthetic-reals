This is an attempt to make use of [Booij 2020 - Analysis in Univalent Type Theory](https://abooij.blogspot.com/p/phd-thesis.html) to get a _cauchy-complete archimedean field_ into `--cubical` Agda as [suggested in a Github issue](https://github.com/agda/cubical/issues/286). I am quite verbosely copying from [chapter 4](chapter-4-1.md) of Booij's thesis.

The main file is [SyntheticReals.agda](agda/SyntheticReals.agda) that is also [rendered in clickable html](https://mchristianl.github.io/synthetic-reals/html/SyntheticReals.html) and [a literate agda version](https://mchristianl.github.io/synthetic-reals/html/) is in the making.
