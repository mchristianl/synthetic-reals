This is an attempt to make use of [Booij 2020 - Analysis in Univalent Type Theory](https://abooij.blogspot.com/p/phd-thesis.html) to get a _cauchy-complete archimedian field_ into `--cubical` Agda as [suggested in a Github issue](https://github.com/agda/cubical/issues/286). I am quite verbosely copying from chapter 4 of Booij's thesis.
