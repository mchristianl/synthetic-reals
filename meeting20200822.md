# Summary

## Questions from the video

- characterization of abs on ℂ
  - one property could be `iᶜ : ℝ → ℂ`, `|·|ᶜ : ℂ → ℝ` is such that `∀(x : ℂ) → | x |ᶜ ≡ | | x |ᶜ |ʳ`
  - but this is kind of weak and there have to be more properties
- characterization of `sqrt` on `ℝ₀⁺`
  - `√x · √x ≡ x` and `√(x · x) ≡ x`
  - use eulers algorithm as an "implementation" (because it is simple)
- disjointness does not need vice-versa, because `P → ¬Q` is equivalent to `Q → ¬P`
- Q: definitions of "ℝ or ℂ"
  - A: using R-modules should already leverage this

## immediate TODOs

- proof of `0 ≤ x → x < y → 0 < x + y` from sketch
- turn the 10 direct inclusions into 4 chained inclusions `ℕ↪ℤ`, `ℤ↪ℚ`, `ℚ↪ℝ`, `ℝ↪ℂ`
  - this should give difficult preservation properties of how the `abs` function interacts with inclusion into the complex numbers a single spot of occurence in `ℝ↪ℂ` and we need not to care about `ℤ↪ℂ` or similar
- since we want apartness `_#_` and absolute value function `abs` on all algebraic structures that are "backing" the number hierarchy, it'd be more sound to rename the `Semiring` into `ApartnessSemiring` or `ApartnessAbsSemiring`
  - or even skip all this and name it `ℕ-struct`
- the embedding from the standard library does not apply to types with structure but only to their carrier set
  - this becomes obvious, since a type with structure is a tuple and not a type
- a constructive characterization for the complex numbers that would be "compatible" to state facts about the abs function could be
  - ?? `∀(x : ℂ) → x # 0ᶜ → Σ[ r ∈ ℝ₀⁺ ] → ∃[ φ ∈ ℝ ] → x ≡ r · exp (i · φ)` ??
    - this is not a sufficient characterization because it does not chacacterize abs on all of ℂ
    - even if we'd add `abs 0 = 0` to it, still this would require splitting ℂ into two parts (zero and nonzero) to make a complete characterization which is not possible constructively
    - so we might add a continuity-characterization to it (i.e. `abs` is ε-δ-continuous) from which should follow `abs 0 = 0`
    - but still this is likely not the most elegant characterization
    - pitfall: define a notion of continuity on ℂ without making use of the absolute value function is tricky
  - this would be a "continuous" formulation and it made `x # 0ᶜ` and `φ ∈ ℝ` necessary
  - ?? how to define `exp`? ??
- Auke's chapter 8 gives metric spaces and pesudometric spaces
  - and complete metric spaces
- vector spaces can be formalized as R-modules
  - whith scalar multiplication being defined as a "ring over the space of linear endomorphisms of the carrier set"
  - and then we instance-proof an ℝ-module or a ℂ-module
  - it cannot be proven constructively that every finite dimenional vector space has a basis (i.e. we cannot constructively pick such a basis)
    - therefore we might add a `VectorSpaceWithBasis` that comes equipped with a basis already
- apartness on normed vector spaces from the norm: `x # 0ᵛ := || x ||ᵛ #ʳ 0ʳ` for the underlying ring
  - similar `x # y := || (x - y) ||ᵛ #ʳ 0ʳ`
- ?? are there "normed R-modules" then (for normed vector spaces)? ??
- `‹ x , x ›ᶜ ∈ ℝ` follows from conjugate symmetry of `‹_,_›ᶜ` and a property of `conjᶜ`
  - `∀ z → z ≡ conjᶜ z → Σ[ r ∈ ℝ ] ℝ↪ℂ r ≡ z`
    - and we should also have the back direction `∀ r → ℝ↪ℂ r ≡ conjᶜ (ℝ↪ℂ r)` which follows from preservation of `conj` along `ℝ↪ℂ` and that `congʳ = idʳ`

## facts and heuristics about constructive mathematics

- cauchy convergence on function spaces could be difficult
- there are several structure identity principles
- that some structure identity principle applies for a mathematical structure is a property of that structure (i.e. the SIP does not generally apply)
  - e.g. for topological spaces (in the classical definition) it does not apply
  - e.g. for fields it is also difficult, since `_¯¹` is only partially defined
- when the SIP from the Σ-theory applies, then we have that "structure preserving bijections" make "the" equivalences between two mathematical structures
  - this also means that for the mathematical structures for which this applies, we have that one does not need to care about the properties
    - the question of "whether the properties are preserved automatically" does not typecheck, i.e. it does not direcly make sense
    - but what it means, could be "whether it is possible to add any new (!) information/properties to a bijected structure when using the bijection that were not derivable before on the bijected structure alone"
      - ?? for "types with structure" this should not be the case ??
  - ?? we had some point about a difference of sets and types ??
- subsets/subspaces
  - ?? embeddings "are" subspaces ??
  - ?? SIP minus one of the identities is an injection/embedding ??
  - "the" set theory is what we find in `Cubical.Foundations.Logic`
  - subsets are predicates (i.e. X → hProp where X isSet)
  - subspaces are spaces over subsets
- what is meant by "structure preserving" is straight forward for n-ary operations and n-ary relations
- constructive topology know a multitude of different formalizations, where classical topology is relatively clear-cut
- there are three separate things
  - the carrier set
  - the structure on the carrier set
    - ?? structure = n-ary operations and n-ary relations ??
  - and axioms for these
- we have trichotomy `∀(q r : ℚ) → (q < r) ⨄ (q ≡ r) ⨄ (r < q)` on ℚ
  - therefore, we do have a linear order `∀ x → (x ≤ 0) ∨ (0 ≤ x)` on ℚ
- we do not have trichotomy on ℝ
  - in particular, we do not have `∀ x → x # 0 ⨄ x ≡ 0`
  - and we do not have a linear order on ℝ, since trichotomy implies the linear order
  - but we have `x # 0 → 0 < x ⨄ x < 0`
  - and we have cotransitivity `∀ x y z → x < y → (x < z) ∨ (z < y)`
    - which is similar in the sense that `∀ z ε → 0 < 0 + ε → (z < 0 + ε) ∨ (0 < z)` follows from it
  - and we have `∀ x → ¬(x < 0) → ¬(0 < x) → x ≡ 0` by antisymmetry of `<`
- some classical properties (that do not assume any structure classically) come with an additional structure in their constructive form (if there is a constructive form)
  - assuming an additional structure is "weaker" than not doing so

## further development and theory

- assuming a lot of given structure to work with
  - e.g. multivalued piecewise continuous functions over a simplicial complex
    - this makes a functions argument into a tuple of a cell AND a coordinate within that cell
    - ?? we might then add a `coincides` relation that relates these points of different cells that "are" the same point ??
    - ?? what about the interior of a set? it could be in the theory that the cell complex is defined as mapping only the interior of a cell ??
    - ?? how to define interior if it becomes necessary ??
  - allowing set operations only on cell-granulariy (e.g. cutting a complex, splitting a complex)
