# Summary

## Questions from the video

- characterization of abs on ℂ
  - one property could be `iᶜ : ℝ → ℂ`, `|·|ᶜ : ℂ → ℝ` is such that `∀(x : ℂ) → | x |ᶜ ≡ | | x |ᶜ |ʳ`
  - but this is kind of weak and there have to be more properties
- characterization of `sqrt` on `ℝ₀⁺`
  - `√x · √x ≡ x` and `√(x · x) ≡ x`
  - use eulers algorithm as an "implementation" (because it is simple)
- disjointness does not need vice-versa, because `P → ¬Q` is equivalent to `Q → ¬P`
- Q: definitions of "ℝ or ℂ"
  - A: using R-modules should already leverage this

## immediate TODOs

- proof of `0 ≤ x → x < y → 0 < x + y` from sketch
- turn the 10 direct inclusions into 4 chained inclusions `ℕ↪ℤ`, `ℤ↪ℚ`, `ℚ↪ℝ`, `ℝ↪ℂ`
  - this should give difficult preservation properties of how the `abs` function interacts with inclusion into the complex numbers a single spot of occurence in `ℝ↪ℂ` and we need not to care about `ℤ↪ℂ` or similar
- since we want apartness `_#_` and absolute value function `abs` on all algebraic structures that are "backing" the number hierarchy, it'd be more sound to rename the `Semiring` into `ApartnessSemiring` or `ApartnessAbsSemiring`
  - or even skip all this and name it `ℕ-struct`
- the embedding from the standard library does not apply to types with structure but only to their carrier set
  - this becomes obvious, since a type with structure is a tuple and not a type
- a constructive characterization for the complex numbers that would be "compatible" to state facts about the abs function could be
  - ?? `∀(x : ℂ) → x # 0ᶜ → Σ[ r ∈ ℝ₀⁺ ] → ∃[ φ ∈ ℝ ] → x ≡ r · exp (i · φ)` ??
    - this is not a sufficient characterization because it does not chacacterize abs on all of ℂ
    - even if we'd add `abs 0 = 0` to it, still this would require splitting ℂ into two parts (zero and nonzero) to make a complete characterization which is not possible constructively
    - so we might add a continuity-characterization to it (i.e. `abs` is ε-δ-continuous) from which should follow `abs 0 = 0`
    - but still this is likely not the most elegant characterization
    - pitfall: define a notion of continuity on ℂ without making use of the absolute value function is tricky
  - this would be a "continuous" formulation and it made `x # 0ᶜ` and `φ ∈ ℝ` necessary
  - ?? how to define `exp`? ??
- Auke's chapter 8 gives metric spaces and pesudometric spaces
  - and complete metric spaces
- vector spaces can be formalized as R-modules
  - whith scalar multiplication being defined as a "ring over the space of linear endomorphisms of the carrier set"
  - and then we instance-proof an ℝ-module or a ℂ-module
  - it cannot be proven constructively that every finite dimenional vector space has a basis (i.e. we cannot constructively pick such a basis)
    - therefore we might add a `VectorSpaceWithBasis` that comes equipped with a basis already
- apartness on normed vector spaces from the norm: `x # 0ᵛ := || x ||ᵛ #ʳ 0ʳ` for the underlying ring
  - similar `x # y := || (x - y) ||ᵛ #ʳ 0ʳ`
- ?? are there "normed R-modules" then (for normed vector spaces)? ??
- `‹ x , x ›ᶜ ∈ ℝ` follows from conjugate symmetry of `‹_,_›ᶜ` and a property of `conjᶜ`
  - `∀ z → z ≡ conjᶜ z → Σ[ r ∈ ℝ ] ℝ↪ℂ r ≡ z`
    - and we should also have the back direction `∀ r → ℝ↪ℂ r ≡ conjᶜ (ℝ↪ℂ r)` which follows from preservation of `conj` along `ℝ↪ℂ` and that `congʳ = idʳ`

## facts and heuristics about constructive mathematics

- cauchy convergence on function spaces could be difficult
- there are several structure identity principles
- that some structure identity principle applies for a mathematical structure is a property of that structure (i.e. the SIP does not generally apply)
  - e.g. for topological spaces (in the classical definition) it does not apply
  - e.g. for fields it is also difficult, since `_¯¹` is only partially defined
- when the SIP from the Σ-theory applies, then we have that "structure preserving bijections" make "the" equivalences between two mathematical structures
  - this also means that for the mathematical structures for which this applies, we have that one does not need to care about the properties
    - the question of "whether the properties are preserved automatically" does not typecheck, i.e. it does not direcly make sense
    - but what it means, could be "whether it is possible to add any new (!) information/properties to a bijected structure when using the bijection that were not derivable before on the bijected structure alone"
      - ?? for "types with structure" this should not be the case ??
  - ?? we had some point about a difference of sets and types ??
- the "purpose" of SIP is to support the one-liner: "equality 'is' equivalence" (and vice-versa)
  - [Univalence](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/univalence+axiom): For any two types `X`, `Y`, this map `(X = Y) → (X ≃ Y)` is an equivalence.
  - (Cubical.Foundations.Id) `univalenceId : ∀ {ℓ} {A B : Type ℓ} → (A ≡ B) ≃ (A ≃ B)`
- subsets/subspaces
  - ?? embeddings "are" subspaces ??
  - ?? SIP minus one of the identities is an injection/embedding ??
  - "the" set theory is what we find in `Cubical.Foundations.Logic`
  - subsets are predicates (i.e. X → hProp where X isSet)
  - subspaces are spaces over subsets
- what is meant by "structure preserving" is straight forward for n-ary operations and n-ary relations
- constructive topology know a multitude of different formalizations, where classical topology is relatively clear-cut
- there are three separate things
  - the carrier set
  - the structure on the carrier set
    - ?? structure = n-ary operations and n-ary relations ??
  - and axioms for these
- we have `∀ x y → x # 0 → (x < y) ⨄ (y < x)` on ℚ and ℝ
  - and we have `¬(x # y) → x ≡ y` by tightness of `#`
  - and we have `x ≡ y → ¬(x # y)` by irreflexivity of `#`
- we have trichotomy `∀(q r : ℚ) → (q < r) ⨄ (q ≡ r) ⨄ (r < q)` on ℚ
  - therefore, we do have a linear order `∀ x → (x ≤ 0) ∨ (0 ≤ x)` on ℚ
  - linear order gives `∀ x y → (max x y ≡ x) ∨ (max x y ≡ y)`
  - without a linear order, we still have
    - `∀ x y z → (z < max x y) ⇔ (z < x) ∨ (z < y)`
    - `∀ x y z → (min x y < z) ⇔ (x < z) ∨ (y < z)`
- **we do NOT have trichotomy on ℝ**
  - in particular, we do NOT have `∀ x → x # 0 ⨄ x ≡ 0`
  - and we do NOT have a linear order on ℝ, since trichotomy implies the linear order
  - but we still have `x # 0 → (0 < x) ⨄ (x < 0)`
    - we do NOT have `∀ x → (abs x ≡ x) ∨ (abs x ≡ - x)`
    - but maybe we have `x # 0 → (abs x ≡ x) ⨄ (abs x ≡ - x)`
  - and we have cotransitivity `∀ x y z → x < y → (x < z) ∨ (z < y)`
    - which is similar in the sense that `∀ z ε → 0 < 0 + ε → (z < 0 + ε) ∨ (0 < z)` follows from it
    - with `x = 0` and `y = ε` we get `∀ ε z → 0 < ε → (0 < z) ∨ (z < ε)`
      - which should be equivalent to `∀ z → (0 < z) ∨ (∀ ε → 0 < ε → (z < ε))`
    - so `∀ ε → 0 < ε → (z < ε)` which is `¬(ε < z)` or `z ≤ ε` is somehow weaker than `z ≤ 0` which is `¬(0 < z)`
      - so we get                                          `∀ z → z ≤ 0 →            (∀ ε → 0 < ε → z ≤ ε)`
      - which is similar to item `R3.12` in [Bridges 1999] `∀ z → 0 ≤ z → ((z ≡ 0) ⇔ (∀ ε → 0 < ε → z < ε))`
      - in particular `∀ z → 0 ≤ z → (∀ ε → 0 < ε → z < ε) → z ≡ 0`
    - so we should have `∀ z → 0 ≤ z → (0 < z) ∨ z ≡ 0`
  - and we have `∀ x → ¬(x < 0) → ¬(0 < x) → x ≡ 0` by antisymmetry of `<`
- some classical properties (that do not assume any structure classically) come with an additional structure in their constructive form (if there is a constructive form)
  - assuming an additional structure is "weaker" than not doing so
- we do not have just `IsCauchy` as a "property", we do have a `ModulusOfCauchyConvergence` as a "structure" for a given sequence
  - cauchy completeness then does not turn `IsCauchy`-sequences into limits, but sequence-modulus-pairs instead
- literature
  - (famous for the development are: Brouwer, Bishop (1967) and Bridges (1985))
  - [Bridges 1990 - Linear mappings are fairly well-behaved](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2FBF01188684)
    - in the presence of completeness linear maps are well-behaved in our formal sense and have certain other aspects of good behaviour as well.
    - Let us agree that a linear mapping `T` between normed spaces is well-behaved if `T x ≠ 0` whenever `x ∈ E` is distinct from each element of `ker (T)`, the kernel of `T`.
    - (Note that when we say that two elements `x`, `y` of a metric space `(X, ρ)` are distinct, and we write `x ≠ y`, we mean that `ρ(x, y) > 0`.)
    - It is perhaps surprising that we cannot prove constructively that every bounded linear mapping `T : ℝ → ℝ`, is well-behaved.
    - For if we could do this, then, by considering mappings of the form `x ↦ ax` where `a ∈ ℝ` and `¬(a = 0)`, we would be able to prove the statement `∀ x ∈ ℝ → (¬(x = 0) ⇒ x ≠ 0)`, which is equivalent to Markov's principle:
      - if `(aₙ)` is a binary sequence such that `¬ (∀ n → (aₙ = 0))`, then there exists `n` such that `aₙ = 1`.
    - (Note, in passing, that Markov's principle implies constructively that every linear map between normed spaces is well-behaved.)
    - Although some constructive mathematicians are prepared to accept Markov's principle, most are not, and we remain unconvinced of the constructive validity of any proposition that entails it.
    - Theorem 1. A linear mapping of a normed space onto a Banach space is well-behaved.
    - A mapping f between metric spaces is said to be
      - one-one, if `f(x) = f(y)  ⇒  x = y`
      - strongly one-one, if `x ≠ y  ⇒  f(x) ≠ f(y)`
      - Corollary 0: A one-one linear map of a normed space onto a Banach space is strongly one-one
    - ... graph
    - ... some extensionality
    - linearly independent
    - metrically independent
  - [Bridges 1999 - Constructive mathematics: a foundation for computable analysis](https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/82492373.pdf) has a section about "Constructive axioms for the real line"
    - (writes `x ≠ y` for `x # y`)
    - We identify the sets ℕ of natural numbers, ℕ⁺ of positive integers, ℤ of integers, and ℚ of rational numbers with the usual subsets of ℝ: for example we identify ℕ⁺ with `{n1 : n ∈ ℕ⁺}`
    - We assume that all relations and operations are extensional: for example, to say that the relation `>` is extensional means that if `x > y`, `x = x'`, and `y = y'`, then `x' > y'`.
    - `x ≠ y` iff (`x > y` or `y > x`)
    - `x > y` iff `∀ z → (y > z) ⇒ (x > z)`
    - R1. `R` is a Heyting field `∀(x y z : R)`
      - `x + y = y + x`
      - `(x + y) + z = x + (y + z)`
      - `0 + x = x`
      - `x + (- x) = 0`
      - `x · y = y · x`
      - `(x · y) · z = x · (y · z)`
      - `1 · x = x`
      - `x · x ⁻¹ = 1` if `x ≠ 0` (`¬(x = 0)` is not sufficient)
      - `x · (y + z) = x · y + x · z`
    - R2. Basic properties of `>` …
      - `¬((x < y) ∧ (y < x))` (irreflexivity, equivalent to `x < y → ¬ y < x`)
      - `(x > y) ⇒ (∀ z → (x > z) ∨ (z > y))` (cotransitivity)
      - `¬(x ≠ y) ⇒ (x = y)` (tightness)
      - `(x > y) ⇒ (∀ z → (x + z) > (y + z))` (+-preserves-<)
      - `(x > 0) ∧ (y > 0) ⇒ (x · y > 0)`
        - ⇔ `(x - z > 0) ∧ (y > 0) ⇒ ((x - z) · y > 0)`
        - ⇔ `(x > z) ∧ (y > 0) ⇒ (x · y > z · y)`
        - ⇔ `(y > 0) → (x > z) → (x · y > z · y)` (·-preserves-<)
    - the notions _bounded above_, _bounded below_, and _bounded_ are defined as in classical mathematics
      - e.g. if `S` is a _nonempty_ subset of ℝ that is bounded above, then its _least upper bound_, if it exists, is the unique real number `b` such that
        - `b` is an upper bound of `S`, and
        - for each `b' < b` there exists `s ∈ S` such that `s > b'`.
        - ?? `supremum S = Σ[ b ∈ S ] (IsUpperBound S b) × (∀ b' → b' < b → ∃[ s ∈ S ] b' < s)` ??
      - (Note that nonempty means what the intuitionists call "inhabited"; that is, we can construct an element of the set in question.)
    - R3. Special properties of `>` …
      - `¬(x > x)`
      - `x ≥ x`
      - `(x > y) ∧ (y > z) ⇒ x > z`
      - `¬((x > y) ∧ (y ≥ x))`
      - `(x > y ≥ z) ⇒ (x > z)`
      - `(x ≥ y > z) ⇒ (x > z)`

      - `∀ m m' n n' → 0 < n → 0 < n' → (m / n > m' / n') ⇔ (m · n' > m' · n)`
      - `∀(n ∈ ℕ⁺) → (n ⁻¹ > 0)`

  - [Bridges 2006 - Techniques of Constructive Analysis](https://books.google.de/books?id=H5BEsaM9XQcC) seems to have a chapter about Hilbert spaces which also defines adjoints
  - [Diener 2008 - Compactness Under Constructive Scrutiny](http://ir.canterbury.ac.nz/bitstream/handle/10092/1823/thesis_fulltext.pdf?sequence=1) has a chapter about "Differentiable manifolds"
  - [Richman 2007 - Real numbers and other completions](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.145.454&rep=rep1&type=pdf) writes about
    - completeness of metric spaces,
    - axioms for the real numbers, and a construction of the real numbers that is appropriate for those axioms.

    - [Schwichtenberg 2019 - Constructive analysis with witnesses](http://www.mathematik.uni-muenchen.de/~schwicht/seminars/semws19/constr19.pdf)
      - defines real numbers as sequence-modulus-pairs
        - uses `1 / 2ᵖ` for `ε`, depending on `p`
      - starts directly with "1.1. Approximation of square roots"
      - has metric spaces, normed spaces, ordinary differential equations

## further development and theory

- assuming a lot of given structure to work with
  - e.g. multivalued piecewise continuous functions over a simplicial complex
    - this makes a functions argument into a tuple of a cell AND a coordinate within that cell
    - ?? we might then add a `coincides` relation that relates these points of different cells that "are" the same point ??
    - ?? what about the interior of a set? it could be in the theory that the cell complex is defined as mapping only the interior of a cell ??
    - ?? how to define interior if it becomes necessary ??
  - allowing set operations only on cell-granulariy (e.g. cutting a complex, splitting a complex)

  - ([A Heyting field ... is essentially a field with an apartness relation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heyting_field))
    - A commutative ring is a Heyting field if `¬(0 ≡ 1)`, either `a` or `1 - a` is invertible for every `a`, and each noninvertible element is zero.
    - The first two conditions say that the ring is local; the first and third conditions say that it is a field in the classical sense.
    - The apartness relation is defined by writing `a # b` if `a - b` is invertible.
    - This relation is often now written as `a ≠ b` with the warning that it is not equivalent to `¬(a ≡ b)`.
    - For example, the assumption `¬(a ≡ 0)` is not generally sufficient to construct the inverse of `a`, but `a ≠ 0` is.

- Isabelle's `(abs_le_iff)` means that `abs` is defined as `max(x, -x)`
- replace ≤ with < for constructive assumption
- take [Booij 2020] definition of metric space
- there is an article about [(archimedean) absolute value functions](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/absolute+value) on the nLab
  - we cannot constructively prove that `(| x | ≡ x) ∨ (| x | ≡ - x)`
  - we have `x # 0 → 0 < x ⨄ x < 0`, so maybe we have `x # 0 → (| x | ≡ x) ∨ (| x | ≡ - x)`
  - tightness of `#` gives `¬(x # 0) → x ≡ 0`
  - ?? we do not have `(x # 0) ⨄ ¬(x # 0)` i.e. apartness is not decidable ??
    - that might be why `x # 0` is a "strong" property already
    - [Ruitenburg 1991 - Inequality in Constructive Mathematics](https://projecteuclid.org/download/pdf_1/euclid.ndjfl/1093635926) writes:
      - There are different versions of constructive inequality that only in classical mathematics are equal to the one standard inequality.
      - Examples are: **denial inequality**, where `x ≠ y` if and only if it is not true that `x = y` that is, `¬(x = y)`;
      - and **tight apartness**, whose axiomatization we will present later on.
      - The natural inequality on the set of real numbers R, defined by `r ≠ s` if and only `| r - s | > 1 / n` for some natural number n, is a tight apartness.
      - Tight apartness and denial inequality are independent; a tight apartness need not be a denial inequality, a denial inequality need not be a tight apartness.
    - [Ciaffaglione - A Tour with Constructive Real Numbers](https://users.dimi.uniud.it/~pietro.digianantonio/papers/copy_pdf/RealsAxioms.pdf)
      - _"the apartness relation (#) [...] is a semi-decidable version of the inequality (≠) [...] it is definable in terms of the order relation"_
    - and I found [this Github discussion](https://github.com/andrejbauer/dedekind-reals/issues/8)
      - equality is not decidable on the real numbers [so I guess apartness then is also not decidable]
      - univalent foundations are a "non-setoid approach"
      - _"to compute digit expansions requires deciding an inequality (in the above example, to decide x<1), which cannot be done for arbitrary reals"_ (the example was `3/3` being `1.000...` or `0.999...`)
      - _"if you can decide inequalities, you can decide equalities (modulo getting the exact statement of this claim right)"_
      - _"One solution is to work instead with signed digit expansions, as is often done in computable and constructive analysis"_
      - _"In signed digit expansions, the digits of the (decimal, say) digit expansion range from -9 to +9, rather than from 0 to +9."_
      - _**"if x<y is decidable for all x,y, then apartness is decidable, which iin particular implies that equality is decidable (since the negation of apartness is equality, and apartness implies the negation of equality)"**_
        - so I guess that none of `_<_`, `_#_` and `_≡_` are decidable then
        - that's (for me) some intuitive heuristic for what properties we have and what we do not have on ℝ
        - the only "sources" of inhabitants of `_<_`, `_#_` and `_≡_` are
          - `0ʳ`, `1ʳ` and everything we can make out of them (which amounts to ℕ, ℤ and ℚ)
          - and `sqrt`
- there is an article about [archimedean valued fields](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/archimedean+valued+field) on the nLab
- there is an article about [square roots](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/square+root) on the nLab
  - what about `abs x = max x (- x) = sqrt (x · x)` ?
- for rings (ℤ), there seems to be [a hierarchy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integral_domain)
  - rngs
  - ⊃ rings
  - ⊃ commutative rings
  - ⊃ integral domains
  - ⊃ integrally closed domains
  - ⊃ GCD domains
  - ⊃ unique factorization domains
  - ⊃ principal ideal domains
  - ⊃ Euclidean domains
  - ⊃ fields
  - ⊃ algebraically closed fields
- A [rig](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/rig) is a ring ‘without negatives'
- The term ["rng"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rng_(algebra)) (pronounced rung) is meant to suggest that it is a "ring" without "i", i.e. without the requirement for an "identity element".

## Pathes (`PathP`, `Path`, `_≡_`), Identity (`Id`), two kinds of Equivalences (`_≃_`) and Isomorphisms (`Iso`)


- there is an article about [Cubical Agda](https://homotopytypetheory.org/2018/12/06/cubical-agda/) by Anders Mörtberg
  - it seems that the identity type `Id` is not yet "ready" for pattern matching (WIP) but its "purpose" is to make "pattern-matching" possible (I guess)
  - _"Note that the cubical identity types are not an inductive family like in HoTT which means that we cannot use Agda’s pattern-matching to match on them. Furthermore Cubical Agda doesn’t support inductive families yet, but it should be possible to adapt the techniques of Cavallo/Harper presented in [...] in order to extend it with inductive families. The traditional identity types could then be defined as in HoTT and pattern-matching should work as expected."_
  - [Proper support for inductive families in Cubical Agda #3733 ](https://github.com/agda/agda/issues/3733)
    - Jesper Cockx writes papers about pattern matching _"the theory of pattern matching in my papers does not support recursion on dot patterns"_
- these four notions are binary "operations" on types that come in constant / homogeneous variants and depenedent / heterogeneous variants
  - _"The central notion of equality in Cubical Agda is hence heterogeneous equality (in the sense of PathOver in HoTT)."_ (see [manual](https://agda.readthedocs.io/en/v2.6.0/language/cubical.html))
  - heterogeneous equality is already available in non-cubical agda

| notion       | homogeneous | heterogeneous | Agda module |
|--------------|-------------|---------------|-------------|
| PathP        | `_≡_ {A = A} = PathP (λ i → A)` | `postulate PathP : ∀ {ℓ} (A : I → Set ℓ) → A i0 → A i1 → Set ℓ`  | Agda.Builtin.Cubical.Path |
| Identity     | `postulate Id : ∀ {ℓ} {A : Set ℓ} → A → A → Set ℓ` |     | Agda.Builtin.Cubical.Id |
| Equivalence1 | | `A ≃ B = Σ[ f ∈ (A → B) ] isEquiv f`⁽¹⁾                   | Agda.Builtin.Cubical.Glue |
| Isomorphism  | | `Iso = f + f⁻¹ + (section f f⁻¹) + (retraction f f⁻¹)` | Cubical.Foundations.Isomorphism |
| Equivalence2 | | `A ≃ B = Σ[ f ∈ (A → B) ] isEquiv f`                   | Cubical.Foundations.Id |

- ⁽¹⁾ `Σ-syntax` is not yet defined in (Agda.Builtin.Cubical.Glue) therefore this is really the unsugared version
  - also it seems that all (Agda.Builtin.*) modules still work on `Set` instead of `Type` (which is just a renamed `Set` from (Agda.Primitive))
- (Cubical.Core.Primitives) defines `Path A a b = PathP (λ _ → A) a b` which is almost `_≡_` from (Agda.Builtin.Cubical.Path)
- pathes cannot cross universes (therefore we need to Lift one side to the other) but `_⇔_` on hProps can (i.e. it can operate on two different universes)
  - it seems that `_⇔_` might be the "preferred" / "most performant" / "least cluttered" way to "store" a path when hProps are available

.

- there is also "definitional equality" of "canonical terms" (normalized terms)
  - and there is "definitional equality" of non-normalized / un-normalizable terms to some degree
- notions of equality come with eliminators, but to some extent we have pattern matching for non-cubical `refl`
  - do we have a similar thing in cubical agda?
- Pathes and `Id` are somehow builtin, where Isomorphisms and Equivalences are defined on-top
  - are they all `isProp`?
  - `PathP (λ i → A) x y` gets printed as `x ≡ y` when `A` does not mention `i` (Cubical.Core.Primitives)

  - `A ≃ B = Σ[ f ∈ (A → B) ] isEquiv f` (a function and an equivalence-proof of it) (Cubical.Foundations.Id)
    - both, (Agda.Builtin.Cubical.Glue) and (Cubical.Foundations.Id) define `_≃_`, (but in a definitionally equal way ?)
      - (Cubical.Foundations.Id) is "on-top" of (Cubical.Foundations.Equiv)
      - this might be for better Have/Goal normalization (?)
      - `_≃_` from (Cubical.Foundations.Equiv) is called `EquivPath` in (Cubical.Foundations.Id)
    - `isEquiv f = ∀ y → isContr (fiber f y)` (all fibers are contractible) (Cubical.Foundations.Id)
    - `isContr A = Σ[ x ∈ A ] ∀ y → x ≡ y` (there exists a point that is equal to all other points) (Cubical.Foundations.Id)
    - `fiber {A = A} f y = Σ[ x ∈ A ] f x ≡ y` (the "fiber over y" is the "inverse image of a singleton `{y}`" (because "inverse image" is defined also for non-singleton sets)) (Cubical.Foundations.Id)
  - `Iso = f + f⁻¹ + (section f f⁻¹) + (retraction f f⁻¹)` (`f` is a section and `f⁻¹` is a retraction) (Cubical.Foundations.Isomorphism)

### "Performance"

Disclaimer: Performance claims always need to be accompanied by (runtime-)measurements and not be based on pure speculation. Since I do not know much about how Agda works internally, the following speculations should be taken with a grain of salt. The current, very dangerous, metric is "term-length": i.e. reducing the length of normalized terms. This can be achieved with the use of `abstract` to block unfolding of terms or by keeping the terms short already in the first place. Therefore, since pathes, equivalences and isomorphisms provide basically the same "mechanism" (i.e. to use them for substitutions), the question arises which one might be the "simplest" in terms of "normalized term-length".

in `Agda.Builtin.Cubical.Glue` it is written that _copatterns don't get unfolded unless a projection is applied_

isoToIsEquiv .equiv-proof y .fst .snd = s y
isoToIsEquiv .equiv-proof y .snd z = lemIso y (g y) (fst z) (s y) (snd z)

-- this is equivalent to
isoToIsEquiv : isEquiv f
(fst (fst ((equiv-proof isoToIsEquiv) y))   ) = g y
(snd (fst ((equiv-proof isoToIsEquiv) y))   ) = s y
(    (snd ((equiv-proof isoToIsEquiv) y)) z ) = lemIso y (g y) (fst z) (s y) (snd z)

```

Maybe we can make a similar use copatterns to split our formulation of algebraic properties and proofs in `MorePropAlgebra` and this already helps to eliminate parts in long normalizations of some terms (see `NOTES.md` → 'example of "cluttered" normalized term').
